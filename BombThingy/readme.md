##KTANEER

This is a small tool, written mostly for fun, to help with playing Steel Crate Games' Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. The intent of this tool is to be something of a replacement of the expert - you input the information you would give to your expert, and recieve the information you would get by your expert as an output. I do not blame you if you think that using this would be cheating, because it arguably is. It could help you play this wonderful game on your own if none of your friends are available at a time, or if you want to test or improve something. The main reason I am making this, though, is to program something. Yes, for fun.

#Improvements

At this stage, this supports some sort of implementations for all the vanilla modules. Needy modules are the exception, but that is mostly due to them needing no input from the expert. I might add a Needy Knob later down the line.

The maze implementation is bad, and in need of something that actually solves the maze.

Principles of OOP aren't actually being followed the way they should be - especially encapsulation. Refactoring the code to be cleaner (and better documented!) is a thing I have planned - not for a certain timeframe though.

Modded modules I might start working on soon. (For that, I will have to do a rework of the base interface, but I already have ideas for that)
